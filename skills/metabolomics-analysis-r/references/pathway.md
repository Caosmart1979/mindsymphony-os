# Pathway Analysis (MetaboAnalystR)

- Prepare metabolite list with IDs (KEGG/HMDB/RefMet).
- Cross-reference IDs and resolve unmatched entries.
- Choose organism and pathway library.
- Run ORA or topology-based analysis in MetaboAnalystR.
- Export pathway tables and plots.


## Lipidomics note

- General pathway databases often lack lipid isomer specificity.
- Prefer LipidMAPS or SMPDB-style mappings; interpret at class level when IDs are coarse.
