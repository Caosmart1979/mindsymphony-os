# Study Design and Sample Size

- Clinical cohorts: aim for >= 30 samples per group when feasible.
- Animal studies: aim for >= 10 per group.
- Cell/plant/microbe studies: aim for >= 8 per group.
- Supervised models (PLS-DA/OPLS-DA) need sufficient replication; avoid < 6 per group unless exploratory.
- Randomize injection order and include pooled QC and blanks in each batch.
