# QC and QA

- Use pooled QC samples every 5-10 injections.
- Monitor RT drift (<0.1 min), mass accuracy (<5 ppm), and QC RSD (target <15-30%).
- Randomize injection order; include blanks and system suitability checks.
- Filter unstable features by QC RSD and missingness.
- Document QC rules and thresholds.
