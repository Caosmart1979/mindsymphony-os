- Type: Infographic illustration
- Orientation: Landscape
- Aspect Ratio: 16:9
- Style: Hand-drawn illustration

Color Palette:
- Primary: Deep blue (#0A1628)
- Secondary: Violet (#6366F1)
- Accents: Neon cyan (#00F0FF), Neon magenta (#FF006E)
- Neutral: Dark gray (#1E293B), Light gray (#CBD5E1)

Visual Elements:

- Data flow lines
- Geometric shapes (hexagons, triangles)
- Glowing effects
- Grid background

Composition:
- Center-aligned, emphasizing symmetry

Topic Description:
The complete end-to-end workflow showing the entire process from user input to final illustrated article.

Visual Content to Include:
- S-shaped or zigzag flow showing 8 steps (numbered):
  1. User input: Terminal/command prompt icon, "用户输入命令"
  2. Analyze: Magnifying glass over document, "读取并分析文章"
  3. Select style: Palette with checkmark, "选择配图风格"
  4. Plan: Document with bullet points, "生成配图方案"
  5. Write prompts: Text document, "写入提示词文件"
  6. Generate: AI brain with image icon, "逐张生成图片"
  7. Insert: Document with image thumbnails being added, "插入图片到文章"
  8. Output: Final document with illustrations, "输出图文并茂文章"
- Each step in a hexagonal node
- Neon arrows connecting steps in sequence
- Circuit pattern lines flowing through the entire diagram
- Steps 1-4 on top row, 5-8 on bottom row (or S-curve)
- Final output (step 8) with brightest glow effect
- Labels: "Fully Automated" and "One Command"

Output as a high-quality image file.
