Create a tech-style infographic illustration about Prompt Assembly Formula.

Image Specifications:
- Type: Infographic illustration
- Orientation: Landscape
- Aspect Ratio: 16:9
- Style: Hand-drawn illustration

Color Palette:
- Primary: Deep blue (#0A1628)
- Secondary: Violet (#6366F1)
- Accents: Neon cyan (#00F0FF), Neon magenta (#FF006E)
- Neutral: Dark gray (#1E293B), Light gray (#CBD5E1)

Visual Elements:
- Circuit board patterns
- Data flow lines
- Geometric shapes (hexagons, triangles)
- Glowing effects
- Grid background

Composition:
- Center-aligned, emphasizing symmetry
- Multi-layered stacking
- Strong sense of depth
- Connection lines between elements

Core Principles:
- Maintain hand-drawn quality throughout, no photorealistic elements
- For sensitive/copyrighted subjects, create stylistically similar alternatives
- Keep information concise and highlight key concepts
- Use generous negative space for visual scanning
- Maintain clear visual hierarchy

Topic Description:
The prompt assembly process showing how a template, style parameters, and specific content combine to create the final prompt.

Visual Content to Include:
- Formula-style layout: A + B + C = D
- Component A (left): Document icon labeled "系统模板" (System Template), in a hexagon frame
- Plus sign in neon cyan
- Component B (center-left): Palette icon labeled "风格参数" (Style Parameters), in a hexagon frame
- Plus sign in neon cyan
- Component C (center-right): Text icon labeled "具体内容" (Specific Content), in a hexagon frame
- Equals sign (large, glowing)
- Component D (right): Document with sparkle effects labeled "最终提示词" (Final Prompt), in a highlighted hexagon frame with strongest glow
- Circuit lines connecting components flowing toward the result
- Each component showing snippet preview (lines representing text)
- Gradient effect from input components (dimmer) to output (brighter)
- Labels: "Modular Design" and "Reusable"

Output as a high-quality image file.
