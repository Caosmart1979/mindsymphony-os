Create a tech-style infographic illustration about Progressive Loading Mechanism.

Image Specifications:
- Type: Infographic illustration
- Orientation: Landscape
- Aspect Ratio: 16:9
- Style: Hand-drawn illustration

Color Palette:
- Primary: Deep blue (#0A1628)
- Secondary: Violet (#6366F1)
- Accents: Neon cyan (#00F0FF), Neon magenta (#FF006E)
- Neutral: Dark gray (#1E293B), Light gray (#CBD5E1)

Visual Elements:
- Circuit board patterns
- Data flow lines
- Geometric shapes (hexagons, triangles)
- Glowing effects
- Grid background

Composition:
- Center-aligned, emphasizing symmetry
- Multi-layered stacking
- Strong sense of depth
- Connection lines between elements

Core Principles:
- Maintain hand-drawn quality throughout, no photorealistic elements
- For sensitive/copyrighted subjects, create stylistically similar alternatives
- Keep information concise and highlight key concepts
- Use generous negative space for visual scanning
- Maintain clear visual hierarchy

Topic Description:
Progressive loading - a mechanism where AI loads only the essential information first (name/description), then loads detailed content only when needed.

Visual Content to Include:
- Three concentric hexagonal layers, like an accordion or telescoping sections
- Layer 1 (smallest, center): Label "name + description" with "~100 tokens" text, faint opacity
- Layer 2 (medium): Label "SKILL.md" with "main instructions" text, medium opacity
- Layer 3 (largest, outer): Label "detailed parameters" with "styles, prompts, etc" text, full opacity
- Arrows showing the expansion direction from center outward
- Circuit lines connecting the layers
- Each layer has increasing glow intensity
- Text: "Load on Demand" at the bottom
- "Token Saver" badge in corner

Output as a high-quality image file.
